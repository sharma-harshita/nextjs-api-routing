API ROUTES

=> GET
=> POST
=> Dynamic Routes
=> Catch all Routes


Just in case if you dont have index.js file in API folder , then if you are accessig /api it will give you 404 error. So to avoid that you can create a file named. [[...params]]
This will give you a blank screen because no params have been passed.
